# svix-ui — an open-source web UI for self-hosted Svix Webhooks

> **Status:** Planning / pre-implementation. This repository currently holds the
> design and research that the build will be driven from. See [`docs/`](docs/).

## The one-paragraph pitch

The open-source [`svix-server`](https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks) is the
*same Rust binary that powers Svix Cloud* — it ships the full webhook engine
(signing, retries, transformations, channels, polling) under a REST API on port
`8071`. What it **does not** ship is any web UI. The polished **App Portal** your
customers use, and the **admin dashboard** you use to operate the service, are
closed Svix-Cloud / Enterprise features. If you `docker compose up` the OSS
server, you get a headless API and a CLI — every endpoint, secret, and replay is
a `curl` command.

**`svix-ui` fills that gap.** It is a single container image you drop into your
existing Svix `docker-compose.yml` that gives you:

1. an **Operator Console** — create tenants (applications), author event types,
   mint tokens, and watch deliveries across every tenant; and
2. an embeddable, open-source **Consumer App Portal** — the screen your own
   customers use to add endpoints, grab their signing secret, pick which events
   they want, test, and replay failed messages.

Both talk to the unmodified `svix-server` over its REST API. No fork, no patch.

## Why this exists (the verified gap)

| Capability | OSS `svix-server` | Svix Cloud / EE | `svix-ui` |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Webhook engine (signing, retries, transforms, polling) | ✅ | ✅ | uses it |
| REST API + CLI | ✅ | ✅ | uses it |
| Admin / operator dashboard | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ **adds it** |
| Consumer **App Portal** UI | ❌ (returns a placeholder URL) | ✅ | ✅ **adds it** |
| License | MIT | proprietary | MIT (this project) |

The OSS `POST /api/v1/auth/app-portal-access/{app_id}` call still works and
returns a real `{ url, token }` — but in OSS the `url` is a hardcoded placeholder
(`docs.svix.com/app-portal/oss`). As Svix's maintainer put it, *"getting the
token is still very valuable because you can build your own UI."* That is
precisely what this project does.

## Quick start (Docker)

The sample [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) runs the whole stack —
svix-ui + svix-server + PostgreSQL + Redis:

```bash
# 1. start the backend (svix-server needs Postgres + Redis)
SVIX_JWT_SECRET=change-me docker compose up -d postgres redis svix-server

# 2. mint an admin token from the running server
export SVIX_ADMIN_TOKEN=$(docker compose exec -T svix-server svix-server jwt generate | awk '{print $NF}')

# 3. start the UI
SVIX_JWT_SECRET=change-me \
SVIX_UI_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
SVIX_UI_OPERATOR_PASSWORD=change-me \
docker compose up -d svix-ui

# 4. open http://localhost:3000 and sign in as admin / change-me
```

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for every configuration variable.

## Quick mental model

```
Your customer ─▶ Consumer App Portal ─┐
                                       ├─▶ svix-ui (BFF) ─▶ svix-server :8071 ─▶ Postgres + Redis
You (operator) ─▶ Operator Console  ──┘        (holds the admin JWT)
```

- **Architecture & roadmap:** [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md)
- **Use-case walkthroughs:** [`docs/USE-CASES.md`](docs/USE-CASES.md)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000 (needs SVIX_SERVER_URL + token)
npm test               # unit + mocked-BFF tests
npm run test:integration   # against a real svix-server (set SVIX_SERVER_URL + SVIX_ADMIN_TOKEN)
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

CI runs lint, typecheck, the test suite, a production build, and a job that
boots a real `svix-server` and runs the integration suite against it.
